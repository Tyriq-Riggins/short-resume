    <p>From November 2017 to May 2018 I ran an online ecommerce business where i began designing my own branded clothing aswell as dropshipped items onto my store. During this time period i began networking using word of mouth marketing aswell as advertising on different social media platforms. In April i were awarded on a magazine from weonradio for spring time clothings to look out for in my tri-state area. It was a dope cool run i began to understand the dirty work from behind being a CEO and not having anyone work for me. I just let the money work for me and kept advertising until my time came. Definitely something i might just take a look at later on down the run in life.</p>

    <p>This is an preview of the web page created during my final project at New York Code Design Academy. Building this site the languages being used were HTML,CSS, and Javascript. This framework were only built using the front end and no back end languages were structured inside of the website. The overall purpose of this site were to teach young individuals financial literacy through a game like setting. A friend of your choice will upload daily tasks and you'll be able to track their whereabouts. Positive assigned daily task would result into rewards. On the otherhand those who fail to complete task and let procastination affect them they'll lose points resulting it to be a bad investment. Invest wisely because even your own friend will help destroy you.</p>

    <p> This is a preview of a web page that i've created for fun. My favorite sports team is the New York Jets I abide in the area and would watch cbs every sunday at 1pm eastern to watch them play since young. Jamal Adams who is on the front of the home page is an electrifying defensive player for the New York Jets. He has promising votes to be featured in his first probowl year in only his 2nd season entering the league. He's a leader for this team and he has a lot of dog in him to be named captain of the team in his second season. I compare my coding journey to him if i continue to work hard and be the loudest in integrity i'll have the ability to be a more efficient coder.</p>
